           <h2>Science, technology sessions aimed at helping women entrepreneurs</h2>

           <p>Friday, March 14, 2014</p>      

<p>For 20-year-old UF finance junior Ariela Steinberg, being a woman in the business world can feel like walking on eggshells.</p>

<p>“I feel a lot of pressure going into interviews that I don’t think men do … it’s almost like a boys club,” she said.</p>

<p>But a program by UF’s Office of Technology Licensing, UF Tech Connect and the Florida Innovation Hub is seeking to change that.</p>

<p>he program, Empowering Women in Technology Startups, takes women on a 10-week journey where they learn skills to combine science and technology with business to create products and start companies. It is set to begin its third session later this semester.</p>

<p>The sessions are not set in a traditional classroom environment, said Carla Buddensieg, program coordinator. Women who participate in the program are paired with a technology medium and an experienced entrepreneur to simulate creating a company. The final product is presented to a panel of female investors at the end of the program.</p>

<p>Buddensieg said, however, that the program goes beyond teaching women business and technology skills.</p>

<p>Christine Urban participated in the program’s pilot session in Fall 2012. Before eWiTS, she worked with small businesses and owned a spa. She walked away from the program feeling she could do even greater things.</p>

<p>She is now the acting CEO of water resource sustainability company Waterway Ecologics, based out of Tallahassee. She will be returning to the program this Spring as a mentor.</p>

<p>Women interested in the eWiTS program can attend an informational session on Tuesday from 3 to 5 p.m. at the Innovation Hub.</p>

           <h2><a href="http://www.alligator.org/the_avenue/music/article_77a2a27e-9469-11e3-894f-0019bb2963f4.html">The Independent Florida Alligator</a></h2><p>

<p>The question everyone was waiting for was finally asked: “How you like your eggs?” “Fried or fertilized!” responded the crowd.</p>

<p>Yung Humma, Flynt Flossy and Whatchyamacallit of the independent record label Turquoise Jeep performed their YouTube hit, “Fried or Fertilized,” and several other songs for fans Tuesday night at High Dive.</p>

<p>The label, known for its humorous sex-lathered lyrics and equally titillating YouTube videos, gave spectators a show to remember and sweat for.</p>

<p>“By the end of the show, we want you to be sweating just as much as we are,” said Pretty Raheem, another artist on the label.</p>

<p>And sweat they did.</p>

<p>During the group’s performance of “Licky Sticky,” single women were called to the stage to receive lap dances.</p>

<p>Gabriel Allen, a 22-year-old Ocala resident, became an instant “Jeep Rider” — as fans of the label call themselves — when his friend showed him videos on YouTube.</p>

<p>Allen said the label is all about good vibes and having fun.</p>

<p>Yung Humma and Flynt Flossy performed what is perhaps the label’s greatest hit, “Lemme Smang It,” which has almost 12 million views on YouTube.</p>

<p>The audience went crazy, reciting lyrics like, “Ima have you looking like a Wild Thornberry.”</p>

<p>Will Baldock, a 21-year-old UF microbiology senior, has been a Turquoise Jeep fan since his freshman year.</p>

<p>“I think their songs are really funny and provide a resound amount of entertainment,” he said.</p>

<p>Baldock said the concert was everything he hoped for and more.</p>

<p>“It blew my mind,” he said.</p>

<p>Yip Deceiver, a duo formed by Davey Pierce and Nicolas “Dobby” Dobbratz, formerly in the band of Montreal, opened for Turquoise Jeep.</p>

<p>The duo’s energetic and pop-tastic sound had even those who weren’t familiar with them bopping along almost instantly.</p>

<p>After their time in of Montreal, Pierce and Dobby formed Yip Deceiver because they desired to finally do their own thing, Pierce said.</p>

<p>“We’ve been making music ourselves for God knows how long and just kind of got tired of doing other people’s stuff,” he said. “It’s good doing your own thing.”</p>
